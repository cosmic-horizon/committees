## Resource Allocation:

Given the endowment of approx 200k QWOYN tokens, the Oversight Committee has determined that it can generate roughly 6500 QWOYN tokens per month through staking. The funds will be allocated in the following manner:

Restaking: 35% of the generated QWOYN tokens per month will be restaked into the staking pool. Restaking helps to support the growth and security of the network by increasing the staked QWOYN tokens and enhancing network consensus.

Committee Purse:.15% of the generated tokens to be locked into a purse to keep liquid. Any use of these tokens requires unanimous consensus among the oversight committee.

Distribution to Committee Members: The remaining 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens, also equivalent to 3250 tokens per month, will be shared among the committee members. This distribution recognizes the efforts and contributions of committee members and provides an incentive for their active participation and dedication.

Discretionary Use of Restaked Amount: The oversight committee will have the flexibility to determine the use of the restaked QWOYN tokens. They may choose to allocate them towards specific initiatives, community projects, liquidity provisioning, or any other endeavors that align with the committee's purpose and benefit the Qwoyn Network ecosystem. The oversight committee also reserves the right to allocate any amount of the generated Qwoyn distribution to oversight committee members for other purposes instead, if unanimously agreed on.

Unless unanimously agreed on by the entire Oversight committee, the discretionary tokens shall be mostly restaked (35%) with 15% of the total generated tokens set aside in a purse. Any use of discretionary funds must have unanimous approval by the oversight committee.

## Charter Amendments:

The Oversight Committee recognizes that over time, amendments to the committee charter may be necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community. The following process will be followed for charter amendments:

Proposal and Ratification: Any proposed amendments to the committee charter must be submitted to the committee for consideration. After thorough review and discussion within the committee, a proposal will be presented to the Qwoyn Network community for ratification.

General Vote: Charter amendments will be subjected to a general vote, allowing all community members to participate and express their opinion on the proposed changes. The voting process will be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, ensuring equal opportunity for community members to contribute to the decision-making process.

These reviews shall happen no less than every six months or if community members propose to have them more often.  The following guidelines will be followed:

Annual Review: The committee charter will be subject to an annual review, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and relevant. The review will take place at least once per year, providing an opportunity to assess the charter's effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments. This will be an extensive review and there will be reviews made every three months

Evaluation of Charter Alignment: During the annual review, the Oversight Committee will evaluate the charter's alignment with the current goals, objectives, and priorities of the Qwoyn Network. This assessment will ensure that the charter continues to serve as a meaningful framework for the committee's operations.
