The Community Spend Committee will follow a structured internal election process to select committee members and ensure a fair and transparent representation of the community. The following guidelines will be followed:

**Nomination Process:** When a committee position becomes available or during scheduled elections, community members will have the opportunity to nominate themselves or others for committee membership. Nominations can be submitted through a designated channel or platform specified by the committee.

**Election Period:** The committee will establish a specific period for conducting elections. This period will allow ample time for nominations, candidate presentations, and community deliberation before the final voting process.

**Voting Mechanism:** The committee will define the voting mechanism, which may include options such as community-wide voting, committee member voting, or a combination of both. The mechanism will ensure fair representation and equal opportunity for community members to participate in the election process.

**Resignation Protocol:** In the event that a committee member resigns or is unable to fulfill their duties, the committee will follow a predefined protocol to address the vacancy. This may involve the initiation of a by-election or appointment process to fill the vacant position, ensuring the continuity of the committee's operations.

## Responsibilities and Duties:

The Community Spend Committee will have the following key responsibilities and duties in relation to the oversight and distribution of community funds within the Qwoyn Network:

**Distribution of Community Funds:** The committee will oversee the distribution of community funds based on predefined milestones. They will assess project proposals, evaluate their alignment with network goals and evaluation criteria, and allocate funds accordingly.

**Project Vetting:** The committee will thoroughly vet projects that request community funds. This includes reviewing project proposals, assessing their feasibility, impact, and community benefit, and conducting due diligence on the project team and their capabilities.

**Decision-Making on Fund Utilization:** The committee will make informed decisions on the utilization of community funds. They will consider the proposed milestones, project impact, financial prudence, and community benefit when determining the allocation of funds for specific projects.

**Monitoring and Reporting:** The committee will monitor the progress of projects that receive community funds, ensuring that they meet the defined milestones and deliver on their intended outcomes. Regular reporting will be required from project owners to track progress and provide transparency to the Qwoyn Network community.

**Community Engagement:** The committee will actively engage with the Qwoyn Network community to gather input, seek feedback, and involve community members in the decision-making process. They will provide opportunities for community participation, address concerns, and foster transparency in the distribution and utilization of community funds.

By fulfilling these responsibilities, the Community Spend Committee will ensure the effective and responsible distribution of community funds within the Qwoyn Network. Their oversight and decision-making will support projects that align with network goals, promote community engagement, and contribute to the growth and success of the Qwoyn Network ecosystem.

## Decision-Making Process:

**Majority Votes to pass a proposal:** All proposals brought before the committee will be decided by a majority vote. A proposal will be considered approved if it receives more affirmative votes than negative votes from the committee members.

**Proposal Submission Timeline:** Proposals must be submitted to the committee at least 2 weeks before the next committee meeting. For example, if the committee meets on the 15th of the month, proposals must be submitted no later than the 2nd of the month to allow sufficient time for review and consideration by committee members.

**Committee Chair as Tie Breaker:** In the event of a tie vote, the committee chair will act as the tie breaker. The committee chair will cast the deciding vote to reach a resolution.

**Conflict Resolution:** Conflict resolution within the committee will be handled by the Qwoyn Network oversight committee. This separate committee will be responsible for mediating and resolving any conflicts or disputes that may arise during committee deliberations or decision-making processes.

## Meeting Schedule and Communication:

**Meeting Schedule:** The committee will hold regular meetings on the 3rd and 18th of each month at 1800 UTC. This fixed schedule ensures consistent and predictable meeting times for committee members to convene and discuss committee matters.

**Virtual Meeting Platform:** The committee will conduct meetings virtually using Google Meet. This platform will facilitate remote participation and enable effective communication among committee members.

**Meeting Recordings:** All committee meetings will be recorded, and the recordings will be made available to the public. These recordings will be uploaded to the Qwoyn Studios YouTube channel, ensuring transparency and allowing community members to access the meeting proceedings.

**Mandatory Attendance:** It is mandatory for each committee member to attend all scheduled meetings. However, in the event of an emergency, a member may be excused from attendance, and the meeting will be rescheduled to accommodate the member's absence.

**Meeting Notes and Repository:** The committee secretary will be responsible for taking comprehensive notes during meetings. These notes will be posted on the Qwoyn Studios Committees GitHub repository, making them accessible to all stakeholders and ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Public Observation:** Committee meetings will be open to the public, providing an opportunity for community members to observe the proceedings. However, unless a special session is called, public comments will not be entertained during regular meetings. This ensures that the focus remains on the committee's agenda and facilitates efficient decision-making.

## Evaluation and Selection Criteria:

The Community Spend Committee will evaluate project proposals seeking community funds based on predefined criteria to ensure alignment with the committee's purpose and the overall goals of the Qwoyn Network. The following criteria will be considered:

**Alignment with Network Goals:** Assess the extent to which the project proposal aligns with the strategic objectives and mission of the Qwoyn Network.

**Project Milestones:** Evaluate the project's proposed milestones or stages to assess its feasibility, progress tracking potential, and alignment with the allocated funds.

**Impact and Community Benefit:** Consider the potential impact of the project on the Qwoyn Network community, including aspects such as user adoption, network growth, and community engagement.

**Financial Prudence:** Evaluate the financial viability and sustainability of the project, including budgeting, cost-effectiveness, and potential return on investment for the network.

**Project Team and Expertise:** Review the experience, expertise, and track record of the project team or individuals involved, assessing their capability to execute the proposed project successfully and deliver on the intended outcomes.

**Transparency and Accountability:** Consider the project's plan for transparency and accountability, including regular reporting, progress tracking, and community involvement in decision-making processes.

By applying these evaluation and selection criteria, the Community Spend Committee will make informed decisions regarding the allocation of community funds, ensuring responsible resource management and the support of projects that align with the network's goals and benefit the Qwoyn Network community.

## Progress Tracking and Reporting:

The Community Spend Committee will implement a robust system for tracking the progress of approved projects within the Osmosis LP. This section outlines the key components of progress tracking and reporting:

**Milestone-based Progress Tracking:** Approved projects will be divided into significant milestones or stages. The committee will establish clear milestones for each project, allowing for effective tracking of progress and achievement of key objectives.

**Regular Reporting:** Project owners or teams will be required to provide regular updates on their project's progress according to the established milestones. The reporting frequency and format will be determined by the committee, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**Review and Evaluation:** The Aquifer Committee will review the progress reports submitted by project owners or teams. The committee will assess whether milestones are being met, the project is on track, and if any adjustments or support are needed.

**Community Communication:** The committee will communicate project progress to the Qwoyn Network community through designated channels such as official announcements, newsletters, or community forums. This ensures that community members are informed and engaged in the development and milestones achieved within the Osmosis LP projects.

**Adjustments and Support:** If necessary, the committee may provide guidance, support, or recommendations to project owners or teams to help them navigate any challenges, ensure continued progress, and maximize the project's potential impact within the Osmosis LP.

**Transparency and Documentation:** The committee will maintain accurate records and documentation of project progress, updates, and evaluations. These records will be made available to the public to ensure transparency and facilitate community understanding of the projects' advancements.

**Accountability Measures:** The committee will establish accountability measures to ensure project owners or teams fulfill their reporting obligations and make satisfactory progress towards project milestones. This may include periodic reviews, performance assessments, or specific criteria for continued project support.

## Resource Allocation:

Given the endowment of 200,000 QWOYN tokens, the Aquifer Committee has determined that it can generate roughly 5500 QWOYN tokens per month through staking. The funds will be allocated in the following manner:

**Restaking:** 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens will be restaked into the staking pool. Restaking helps to support the growth and security of the network by increasing the staked QWOYN tokens and enhancing network consensus.

**Distribution to Committee Members:** The remaining 50% of the generated QWOYN tokens will be shared among the committee members. This distribution recognizes the efforts and contributions of committee members and provides an incentive for their active participation and dedication.

**Discretionary Use of Restaked Amount:** The committee will have the flexibility to determine the use of the restaked QWOYN tokens. They may choose to allocate them towards specific initiatives, community projects, liquidity provisioning, or any other endeavors that align with the committee's purpose and benefit the Qwoyn Network ecosystem.

## Charter Amendments:

The Community Spend Committee recognizes that over time, amendments to the committee charter may be necessary to adapt to the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community. The following process will be followed for charter amendments:

**Proposal and Ratification:** Any proposed amendments to the committee charter must be submitted to the committee for consideration. After thorough review and discussion within the committee, a proposal will be presented to the Qwoyn Network community for ratification.

**General Vote:** Charter amendments will be subjected to a general vote, allowing all community members to participate and express their opinion on the proposed changes. The voting process will be conducted in a transparent and inclusive manner, ensuring equal opportunity for community members to contribute to the decision-making process.

**Archiving of Old Charter:** Once the community has ratified the charter amendments, copies of the previous charter will be archived in the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures a historical record of the committee's evolution and provides transparency and accessibility for reference purposes.

**Display of New Charter:** The updated and ratified charter will be prominently displayed in the Readme.md file of the committee's GitHub repository. This ensures that the latest version of the charter is easily accessible to all community members and stakeholders.

## Charter Review:

To ensure the ongoing effectiveness and alignment of the committee's operations with the evolving needs of the Qwoyn Network community, the Aquifer Committee will conduct regular charter reviews. The following guidelines will be followed:

**Annual Review:** The committee charter will be subject to an annual review, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and relevant. The review will take place at least once per year, providing an opportunity to assess the charter's effectiveness and make any necessary adjustments.

**Evaluation of Charter Alignment:** During the annual review, the committee will evaluate the charter's alignment with the current goals, objectives, and priorities of the Qwoyn Network. This assessment will ensure that the charter continues to serve as a meaningful framework for the committee's operations.

**Proposal for Charter Amendments:** If any amendments or updates are deemed necessary during the review process, the committee will follow the Charter Amendments section (Section 9) to propose and ratify the changes, involving the community in the decision-making process.

**Community Engagement:** The annual charter review presents an opportunity for community members to provide feedback and suggestions regarding the committee's operations and governance. The committee will actively seek community input and consider it during the review process.
