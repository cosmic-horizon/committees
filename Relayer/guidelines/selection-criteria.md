# Relayer Selection Criteria

When selecting relayers for your network, it is important to consider several criteria to ensure their effectiveness and reliability. Here are some criteria you can use to evaluate and select relayers:

### Technical Competence:

- Relayers should possess a strong understanding of the underlying technology and protocols used in your network, such as IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication).
- Evaluate their experience in working with similar networks or technologies, including their ability to set up and maintain relays effectively.
- Assess their knowledge of network security practices to ensure the safe transfer of assets and data across chains.

### Network Connectivity and Infrastructure:

- Relayers should have robust and reliable network connectivity to ensure uninterrupted communication between different chains.
- Evaluate the quality and capacity of their infrastructure, including servers, bandwidth, and monitoring systems, to handle the expected network traffic efficiently.
- Consider geographic distribution to have relayers in different regions, reducing the risk of single points of failure.

### Reliability and Availability:

- Relayers should demonstrate a high level of reliability and availability. They should be committed to maintaining their relaying services with minimal downtime.
- Look for relayers who have a track record of providing reliable services in similar contexts or have references from reputable projects.
- Assess their ability to respond promptly to issues or incidents and their willingness to actively participate in troubleshooting and resolving problems.

### Governance and Alignment:

- Relayers should be aligned with the overall goals and vision of your network.
- Consider their willingness to adhere to network governance processes and actively contribute to the development and improvement of the network.
- Look for relayers who understand and respect the principles of decentralization, security, and community-driven decision-making.

### Reputation and Trustworthiness:

- Research the reputation of potential relayers within the blockchain community and seek feedback from other projects they have worked with.
- Consider their adherence to ethical practices, transparency, and accountability in their operations.
- Assess their financial stability and sustainability to ensure their long-term commitment to the network.

### Scalability and Performance:

- Evaluate the relayers' ability to handle increasing network traffic and growing demands as the network expands.
- Consider their experience in scaling relaying infrastructure and their plans for future capacity upgrades.

### Support and Collaboration:

- Look for relayers who are willing to actively collaborate with other network participants, including validators, developers, and governance entities.
- Assess their commitment to providing ongoing support and assistance to users and other network stakeholders.
