# Guidelines for Qwoyn Network Relayers

## Channel Maintenance:

- All channels must be regularly updated to prevent expiration. Relayers are responsible for monitoring the expiration dates of channels and taking necessary actions to keep them active.
- Regularly check the status of channels and ensure that they are functioning properly.

## Usability of Channels:

- Channels should have a clear purpose and be actively used. Avoid creating "ghost channels" that serve no practical purpose.
- Before opening a new channel, consider its potential usage and value within the network.
- Evaluate the necessity of existing channels periodically and close unused or redundant channels.

## Unfreezing Expired Channels:

- If a channel expires, it is the responsibility of the relayers to unfreeze it by following the required steps.
- Initiate the process by creating proposals on the respective counterparty chains.
- Engage in discussions within the relevant community, such as the Commonwealth, to gather feedback and support for the channel unfreezing proposal.
- Ensure that all necessary steps, including community discussions and obtaining consensus, are followed as per the established procedures.

## Official Channel Maintenance:

- Consider implementing a standardized process for managing official channels within the Qwoyn Network.
- Create a dedicated repository, such as the Qwoyn repo on GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/_IBC), to document official channels and related information.
- Designate a responsible person, approved by the Committee or relevant governing body, who will be responsible for opening channels and submitting pull requests (PRs) with the necessary IBC path information.
- Upon merging the PR, the channel becomes an official channel that must be maintained continuously.
- Regularly review and update the official channel documentation as needed to ensure accuracy and relevance.

Note: These guidelines are meant to serve as a starting point and should be adapted and expanded based on the specific needs and governance structure of the Qwoyn Network.
